# Plinth
by [Hapaxia](https://github.com/Hapaxia)

A fully-header-only/templated foundation library of many helpful classes and functions.  
Includes an extension section of SFML-based classes and functions.

Requires a minimum of C++11. Note that some parts may required more modern versions.
In particular, the SFML section (now for SFML 3) will require C++17.
However, the entire library should be compatible with C++17+.

Note that to use with SFML 2, you can use the "sfml2" branch.

For information, view the [Wiki].


**IMPORTANT**  
This library has been converted to a fully-header-only/templated library and is now available on the main branch.

**MAIN BRANCH**  
Note also that the main branch was originally named master. To update your clone if you cloned before it was named main, run these commands from your clone:
```
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
