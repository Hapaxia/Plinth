# Plinth
by [Hapaxia](https://github.com/Hapaxia)

A foundation library of many helpful classes and functions.  
Includes an extension module of SFML-based classes and functions.

Requires C++11.

For information, view the [Wiki].


**IMPORTANT**  
This library has recently been converted to a fully-templated library and that version is currently on [fully-template-version branch](https://github.com/Hapaxia/Plinth/tree/fully-template-version). The version with some non-templated functions will be eventually replaced on the master branch.
